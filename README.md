# Boston AirBnb Data Analysis
Analysing the Boston Data for Airbnb. The blog post is here https://medium.com/@mahrane.trabelsi/what-you-need-to-know-before-visiting-boston-8cde97474f0f

## Motivation
This project was created as part of Udacity's Data Scientist nanodegree.

The business questions which I have tried to answer in this project are as follows:
- What is the crowded period during the year in Boston?
- What is the less expensive period to visit Boston?
- Which room types in each neighborhood have high prices?
- Which room types in each street have high prices?

## Dataset Used:
Kaggle Boston AirBnb data https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston.
The following Airbnb activity is included in this Boston dataset:

- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## Libraries Used:
> 1. Numpy 
> 2. Pandas 
> 3. Matplotlib pyplot
> 4. Seaborn
> 5. Sklearn
> 6. plotly


## Language and Frameworks used:
Python3, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- The busiest month for tourism in Boston is September , 60% of the room are not available in this period, followed by October and then Summer period however Winter period is the slowest with tourists.
- The slow/cheap period for tourism in Boston is January-March-Feb. That’s probably when you will also find the best hotel deals.
- South Boston WaterFront , Bay Village and Leather District are the three most expensive neighbourhoods in the Entire home/apt
- The “Edgerly Road, Boston, MA 02115, United States” street is the highest expensive street even with private room
